# NUS Orbital Project 2023 - Spense (Artemis) 

Spense is a receipt management app that enables paperless, seamless and smooth transactions between merchants and customers.
This README documentation is specifically for the frontend. To view the backend documentation, head to [Spense](https://github.com/Jaspertzx/Spense) 

## Usage

We currently have 3 screens for our technical proof of concept. Namely, the signin, signup and home screen.

```html
        <Stack.Screen name="SignIn" component={SignInScreen}/>
        <Stack.Screen name="SignUp" component={SignUpScreen}/>
        <Stack.Screen name="HomeScreen" component={HomeScreen}/>
```
